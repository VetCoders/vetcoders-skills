# rust-mux — VetCoders GUIDELINES

> Per-repo, agent-agnostic instructions. Same rules for Claude, Codex, Gemini, Junie, Qwen.
> Global doctrine in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (and equivalents) still applies; this file
> overrides/extends only where this repo has its own contract.

## Identity

- **Crate:** `rust-mux` v0.4.0 · edition 2024 · MIT OR Apache-2.0
- **Org:** github.com/Loctree/rust-mux
- **Role:** library-first MCP transport multiplexer (`run_mux_server` / `spawn_mux_server` / `MuxHandle`) plus two CLI binaries (`rust-mux`, `rust-mux-proxy`).
- **Active runtime line:** `src/runtime/` (modular). The `src/runtime.rs` monolith is gone (commit `2638441`). Do **not** reintroduce it. `mux-000 runtime duplication` is resolved at HEAD; if a plan still references `src/runtime.rs`, the plan is stale.
- **Active wizard line:** `src/wizard/` (modular). `src/wizard_legacy.rs` and `src/runtime_legacy.rs` are deleted (commit `4b896b3`). Same rule.

## Canonical command surface

Use the `Makefile`. Do **not** invent equivalent ad-hoc cargo invocations; the operator and CI key off these names.

| Target                                                  | Meaning                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make gates`                                            | **Required green before any commit:** `fmt-check + clippy + test` (all features).                                     |
| `make test-full`                                        | `gates` + `--ignored` transport tests (`mux_transport_roundtrip_with_loctree_mcp` needs local `loctree-mcp` running). |
| `make check`                                            | `cargo check --all-targets --all-features`                                                                            |
| `make wizard` / `make wizard-dry-run`                   | Three-step TUI: services → clients → save (with safe vs `[DANGER]` paths).                                            |
| `make run` / `make run-tray`                            | Run mux daemon for `SERVICE` from `CONFIG` (default `~/.codex/mcp-mux.toml`).                                         |
| `make proxy`                                            | Run `rust-mux-proxy` against `SOCKET`.                                                                                |
| `make health` / `make daemon-status` / `make dashboard` | Single-service health, multi-service daemon status, tray dashboard.                                                   |

Override variables on the command line: `make run SERVICE=brave-search CONFIG=~/.codex/mcp.json`.

CI mirrors `make gates` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) with `--no-default-features` so tray drops out cleanly. Anything you add must keep CI green in both feature configurations.

## Quality gates — non-negotiable

Before every commit:

```bash
make gates              # fmt-check + clippy -D warnings + test --all-features
```

For changes touching `runtime/` transport, also run `make test-full` locally (requires `loctree-mcp` binary on PATH).

Suppression policy: do **not** add new `#[allow(...)]`, `// nosemgrep`, `clippy::*` allows, or `#[cfg(test)] dead_code` islands without a one-line `Why:` comment naming the constraint. Existing forgotten silencers are fair game for `vc-prune`.

## Living Tree convention

This repo runs **parallel agents on a shared worktree** (Claude, Codex, Gemini all touching `src/` simultaneously). Concurrent edits are the rule, not the exception.

- Re-read files before editing if more than a few minutes passed since last `slice` / `Read`.
- Before any non-trivial edit window, check `loctree-mcp doctor()` (or atlas `receipt`) to detect a concurrent rescan; if fingerprint moved, call `context(fresh: true)` again.
- Do **not** revert another agent's change unless explicitly asked; if it conflicts with your work, reconcile or report — never silently overwrite.
- Commit in 5–6 file packs when shape allows. `git commit --only <paths>` is **not atomic** vs. parallel commits — your message can land under another agent's envelope. Don't fight it; document in the report and move on.
- `~/.vibecrafted/artifacts/Loctree/rust-mux/<YYYY_MMDD>/{plans,reports}` is auto-rotated daily; the in-repo `.vibecrafted/{plans,reports}` are symlinks to today's directory. Symlink target moving on a date roll is **not** a code change — leave the diff if it appears in `git status`.
- `.vibecrafted/tmp/` is scratch. Anything under `.vibecrafted/` is gitignored (per `/.vibecrafted` rule).

## Structural map (for planning, not for memorization)

Always run `loctree-mcp slice <file>` before editing a hub. Current top hubs (importer counts, drift fast):

| File                 | Importers | Role                                                              |
| -------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/config.rs`      | 13        | `MuxConfig`, `ServerConfig`, `ResolvedParams`, `CliOptions` trait |
| `src/state.rs`       | 11        | `MuxState`, `StatusSnapshot`, error/id helpers                    |
| `src/scan.rs`        | 9         | Host discovery, rewire (1388 LOC — split candidate when touched)  |
| `src/multi.rs`       | 6         | Multi-service supervisor                                          |
| `src/runtime/mod.rs` | 5         | `run_mux`, `run_mux_internal`, entrypoints                        |

Known structural debt — **triage, don't chop:**

- **`src/common.rs` is a half-finished extraction.** Twins exist in `scan.rs` for `HostKind`, `HostFormat`, `as_label`, `display_name`. The `common.rs` copies have 0 importers; the `scan.rs` copies are live. Consolidation is desirable, but `common.rs` is a forgotten gem — preserve the intent, surface it as a `vc-prune`/`vc-marbles` finding, do not delete in passing.
- **`print_status_table`, `DaemonStatus`, `check_health`, `HealthStatus` twins** between `lib.rs` ↔ `runtime/status.rs` and `wizard/types.rs` ↔ `state.rs`. Same triage rule.
- **One cycle:** `src/multi.rs ↔ src/state.rs` (length 2). Acceptable while the supervisor needs `MuxState`; flag if you add a third hop.

## Wizard / config doctrine

The wizard runs a 5-step flow (see `docs/WIZARD.md` for screens):

```
DiscoverySources → ServerReview → StrategyChoice → SummaryConfirm → ResultAndTray
```

**Source of truth is client config files, not running processes.** STEP 1
scans `default_sources()` (`~/.claude.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml`,
`~/.gemini/settings.json`, `~/.junie/`, `~/.ai/`, `~/.agents/`, plus
legacy editor hosts) and lets the operator add custom paths. ps-scan is
demoted to enrichment-only — it stamps PIDs on matching entries and
surfaces ps-only orphans, never drives discovery.

Three strategies on STEP 3, do **not** merge them:

- **Unified → `mux_gen::build_mux_outputs`.** Writes
  `~/.config/mux/{config.toml, mcp.json, mcp.toml}` with every selected
  server, deduplicated. Recommended onboarding flow. Never touches
  host-side AI client configs. STEP 5 prints per-client startup
  snippets (`claude --strict-mcp-config …`, `junie --mcp-location …`,
  `gemini mcp add …`, plus a Codex merge note).
- **Per-client → `mux_gen::build_per_client_outputs`.** Writes one mux
  config per originating client kind in that client's native format
  (`claude.json`, `codex.toml`, `junie.json`, …) under `~/.config/mux/`.
  Daemon `config.toml` still merged across every selected source so
  the running mux can reach every upstream server. Use when different
  agents should see different stacks.
- **`[DANGER]` Auto-rewire → `danger::plan_danger_rewrite` + `execute_plan`.**
  Backup-first, preview-first JSON/TOML rewrite of `.claude/`,
  `.codex/`, `.junie/` host configs with rollback. Always creates
  timestamped `<file>.<unix_seconds>.bak`, always shows the preview,
  always requires explicit `CONFIRM` on cooked stdin. Sources flagged
  `eligible_for_danger = false` (currently Gemini's `settings.json` —
  no verified strict-config flag) are listed but skipped.

Never silently rewrite a host config from a non-danger strategy. Never
skip the backup or the `CONFIRM` prompt on the danger path. Never
reintroduce the legacy `[SAFE GEN] / [MUX ONLY] / [CLIPBOARD]` overlay
— STEP 4's `Confirm / Back / Cancel` is the canonical action chooser.

Reference: `docs/WIZARD.md`, `docs/vc-agents-client-discovery-plan.md`.

## Tray feature dependency risks

The `tray` Cargo feature pulls `tray-icon → muda (gtk feature) → gtk 0.18 → glib 0.18`. As of 2026-05-06 cargo audit reports:

- 1 unsoundness: glib 0.18.5 — **RUSTSEC-2024-0429** (`VariantStrIter::{next, nth, next_back, nth_back, last}` UB; patched in glib >= 0.20.0).
- 8 unmaintained: atk, atk-sys, gdk, gdk-sys, gtk, gtk-sys, gtk3-macros, proc-macro-error (RUSTSEC-2024-0412..0420 + RUSTSEC-2024-0370 — gtk-rs GTK3 bindings archived; migration path is gtk4-rs).

Mitigation in place: CI builds with `--no-default-features`, so library and proxy binary consumers never link the unsound code; only desktop/tray users do.

Active code path: rust-mux's tray code does **not** call `glib::VariantStrIter` directly. The unsound function is reachable only via tray-icon's menu construction code.

Action: track tray-icon for a release that bumps the chain to glib >= 0.20 (or migrates muda to gtk4-rs). Bump in lockstep when available.

Operator-facing impact: none today; no CVE, no exploit path. The advisory is a "correctness debt to clear" rather than a security incident.

## API surface (library users)

The public library surface is what's re-exported from `src/lib.rs`. Keep it stable across patch versions:

```rust
use rust_mux::{
    MuxConfig, MuxHandle, ResolvedParams, CliOptions,
    run_mux_server, spawn_mux_server, run_mux_with_shutdown, check_health,
};
```

Internal modules (`runtime::client`, `runtime::server`, `wizard::services`, ...) are private; if a consumer needs a symbol from there, promote it through `lib.rs` deliberately — do not leak the path.

Feature gating:

- default: `["tray", "cli"]`
- `cli` → wizard, scan, binaries (clap, ratatui, crossterm, tracing-subscriber)
- `tray` → tray-icon + image (GUI deps; CI builds with `--no-default-features` to keep headless green)
- Library-only consumers should depend with `default-features = false`.

## Paths (v0.4.0 canonical)

- Sockets: `~/.rmcp-servers/rust-mux/sockets/<service>.sock`
- Status files: `~/.rust-mux/status/<service>.json` (per-service) or `~/.rmcp-servers/rust-mux/status.json` (combined)
- Mux config (safe wizard): `~/.config/mux/{mcp.json, mcp.toml, config.toml}`
- Default service config: `~/.codex/mcp-mux.toml`
- Detection still matches **legacy `rmcp_mux` patterns** (transition compat); do not strip the legacy regex without a release note.

## .env hygiene

Repo currently ships zero `.env*` files. If you ever need one locally:

- Add the exact filename to `.gitignore` (the existing `/.vibecrafted` + `/*.py` rules are intentional; widening to `.env*` is a normal addition).
- Never commit even an example with real secrets.
- Pre-commit blocks accidental `.env` commits; if a hook fires, fix the cause, don't bypass.

## Commit convention

- Title prefix: `[<agent>/<workflow>] <description>` (e.g. `[claude/vc-implement] add heartbeat config plumbing`).
- Body: bulleted list of changes if non-trivial. Empty bodies are not allowed for multi-file packs.
- **AGENT FAIRNESS.** Trailer authorship goes to the agent that **actually wrote the code**:
  ```
  Authored-By: <agent> <agents@vetcoders.io>
  ```
  where `<agent>` ∈ {`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `junie`, `qwen`}. Multi-agent collaboration → multiple `Authored-By` lines.
- **Forbidden trailers in this repo:**
  - `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus … <noreply@anthropic.com>` and any vendor-default footer.
  - `Co-Authored-By: Maciej/Klaudiusz/<personal handle>` — no personal sigs in commits.
  - Coordinator agents do **not** add their signature to other agents' work.
- Footer ends with the canonical brand line **only when a sigblock is needed** (file headers, release notes, public artifacts):
  ```
  𝚅𝚒𝚋𝚎𝚌𝚛𝚊𝚏𝚝𝚎𝚍. with AI Agents by VetCoders (c)2024-2026 LibraxisAI
  ```
  Note the trailing dot after `𝚅𝚒𝚋𝚎𝚌𝚛𝚊𝚏𝚝𝚎𝚍`, the `2024-2026` range, and `LibraxisAI` (not `VetCoders`).

`Cargo.toml` `authors = [...]` is package metadata (PEP 621 / npm-style), not a sig — leave it alone.

## Init discipline

Every session on this repo starts with:

1. Read `~/.claude/Klaudiusz/kronika_*.md` (or equivalent agent chronicle).
2. `/vc-init` (no-op): perception via `loctree-mcp context()`, intentions via `aicx_intents project=rust-mux`, ground truth via `repo-full`.
3. **Then** touch code.

Skipping init in this repo is how parallel agents step on each other. Don't.

## Anti-patterns specific to this repo

- Reintroducing `src/runtime.rs` monolith because a plan referenced it. The plan is stale.
- Reintroducing `src/runtime_legacy.rs` / `src/wizard_legacy.rs`. They are deleted on purpose.
- Reintroducing the old 4-step wizard (`ServerSelection → ClientSelection → Confirmation → HealthCheck`) or the old `ConfirmChoice` overlay (`[SAFE GEN]/[MUX ONLY]/[CLIPBOARD]/[DANGER]`). The 5-step flow with `Strategy { Unified, PerClient, AutoRewire }` is canonical.
- Reintroducing the `MCP_PATTERNS` whitelist as primary discovery. ps-scan is enrichment-only; configuration discovery runs through `scan::scan_hosts()`.
- Silently dropping the `legacy rmcp_mux` detection regex.
- Merging `src/mux_gen.rs` and `src/danger.rs` into one "wizard config writer" — the strategy split is the security model.
- Bumping `Cargo.toml` version without a matching `CHANGELOG.md` section.
- Editing `AI_README.md` without also re-running structure check (`loctree-mcp focus src/`) — it lies the moment the tree changes.
- Using `socat` instead of `rust-mux-proxy` for host STDIO bridges in examples.
- Adding `#[allow(dead_code)]` to silence a clippy after a refactor instead of either consolidating the twin or surfacing it as a finding.

## Notes for AI agents

- Comments and docstrings: English. Polish is reserved for operator-facing reports under `.vibecrafted/reports/`.
- `.ai-agents/**` and `*.txt` are scratch — do not commit.
- `AGENTS.md` (root, if it appears) is deprecated; ignore it. This file is the canonical per-repo source.
- When you find drift between this file and the code, **the code wins** — open a follow-up to update GUIDELINES, do not bend the code to match stale guidelines.
